# Standard_Bank
Standard Bank transforms home loan processing with AutoML and Bespoke ML. Sweetviz analyzes data, AutoML leverages Sweetviz, and Bespoke ML trains a logistic regression model, later replaced. This aligns with the bank's digital transformation for rapid credit assessments.

## Introduction

In Task 2, we employ the CRISP-DM data science lifecycle to analyze historical data, automate exploration with Sweetviz, and compare AutoML and Bespoke ML methodologies. The project aims to streamline the loan application process at Standard Bank.

## Data Exploration

We utilize Sweetviz for automated data exploration, covering data overview, quality, loan status distribution, dependents, income by employment type, credit history impact, and income-loan amount correlation.

## AutoML

The AutoML section leverages the Sweetviz library for automated analysis, providing insights into the data and training a logistic regression model for credit assessments.

## Bespoke ML

The Bespoke ML section involves traditional machine learning using scikit-learn. We train a logistic regression model and replace it with another model, offering flexibility and comparison with AutoML results.

## Usage

Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.
